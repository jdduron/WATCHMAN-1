2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.073 ns between prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/ramp_pointer_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/saw_pointer_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.159 ns between prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/ramp_pointer_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/saw_pointer_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.172 ns between prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/ramp_pointer_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/saw_pointer_reg[31]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -6.176 ns between prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/ramp_pointer_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and prototype_watchman_i/AXIS_Test_Component_0/U0/AXIS_Peripheral_v2_0_M00_AXIS_inst/saw_pointer_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0).
